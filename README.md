# Sales-analysis-of-Bikes-

In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to clean and analyze a dataset. The dataset contained bikes sales data in Europe, and my goal was to identify trends and patterns in the data that could be used to inform business decisions.

To achieve this goal, I followed a series of steps that are described in detail below. These steps included cleaning the data, analyzing the data using PivotTables, and creating a dashboard to visualize the key findings from the analysis.

Steps
1. Clean the data

The first step in this project was to clean the data. To do this, I used Excel's built-in data cleaning tools to remove duplicates and ensure that the data was clean and accurate.

2. Analyze the data using PivotTables

Once the data was clean, I used Excel's PivotTables feature to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns. This involved selecting the range of data that I wanted to analyze, and then selecting the fields that I wanted to summarize and analyze. Excel then created a PivotTable report that displayed the summarized data in a user-friendly, interactive format.

3. Create a dashboard

Finally, I used Excel's data visualization tools to create a dashboard that displayed the key findings from the analysis in an easy-to-understand format. The dashboard included charts, graphs, and other visualizations that helped to communicate the key insights from the data analysis.

Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great example of how Microsoft Excel can be used to clean and analyze data, and to generate valuable insights that can be used to inform business decisions. By following the steps outlined above, I was able to clean the data, analyze it using PivotTables, and create a dashboard that effectively communicated the key findings from the analysis.
